## Backstory
In contemporary times, an increasing number of individuals find themselves in a state of mental well-being that is less than optimal, and the likelihood of people experiencing mental health issues is markedly on the rise. However, this situation has not transpired overnight. The accumulation of negative emotions stands out as a primary contributor to mental health challenges.

We present ReFlow to address this predicament, enabling users to derive enjoyment from diary-keeping while also nurturing their mental well-being. We hope that through logging text onto this web app, our users can regain interests in personal expression and feel assured to jot down their most genuine emotion.

## What ReFlow offers
ReFlow facilitates standard diary functionality by serving as a receptacle for user-generated diary entries. Following the input of their entries, ReFlow seamlessly transitions into a perceptive role, attuned to the emotional nuances conveyed within the user's text. It is equipped to furnish engaging textual responses and essential emotional support through the precise evaluation of the user's emotional state and mental well-being, leveraging the advanced capabilities of the ChatGPT large language model. In this manner, ReFlow departs from the conventional diary format, redefining the diary's purpose from a mere utilitarian recording tool to a compassionate and empathetic confidant.

Furthermore, ReFlow's monthly assessment feature serves as an invaluable tool for visualizing one's mental health. A diminishing average monthly mood score should command the user's attention, serving as an early warning signal for the possible emergence of mental health issues. This proactive approach aids in the prevention and timely intervention in the development of mental health challenges.

## How we built it
The web app is built with Next.js and written in TypeScript and JavaScript. We feature elegant prompt engineering for OpenAI API to interact with GPT 4.0. Figma also played a crucial role in drafting web app layout. Background art is generated by DALL-E 2.

## Challenges and outcomes
This is our first time building an AI app, and we spent quite some time in figuring out how to interact with OpenAI API. We also conducted many tests on ChatGPT to establish robust inputs to guide GPT in producing responses within a predetermined format. It was also tricky to manage input data across the app.

With careful examination of documentations and research on associated topics, we succeeded in overcoming these problems. We are proud that the result is tailored to the optimal user experience and provides very positive feedbacks for every usage.

## What's next for ReFlow
We'll continue to improve our app through better furnishing the usre interface, providing more interactive options, and improving feedback quality. We also plan to build backend database for ReFlow  so that every user can keep their diaries in the cloud.
